How to run: Run the main method of the PlayGame class. From there, a popup 
window will appear asking you to choose between beginner and advanced. The
beginner option will start to run the lasermaze card number 7. The advanced
option will start to run the lasermaze card number 13.

The objective of the game is to have the laser interact with every piece on
the board, and end on the target. To do this, you must place each tile from 
the tile box on the right on to the board. Then, you can click these added 
tiles to rotates them in order to solve the puzzle. Once you think you have
the tiles in the right place, you can press the fire button which activates
the laser.
